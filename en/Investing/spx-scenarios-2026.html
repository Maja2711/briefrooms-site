  <!-- INTRO -->
  <section id="intro" class="card">
    <h2>Intro — what this text is (and is not)</h2>
    <p>
      This article summarises three base-case scenarios for the
      S&amp;P 500 index over roughly 1 month, 6 months and 12 months.
      It is anchored in
      <strong>IMF and OECD forecasts</strong> for global growth,
      equity valuations, monetary policy paths for the Fed/ECB,
      and the latest public research from large investment banks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The current consensus of international institutions is that
      in 2024–2026 the world economy will grow by around
      <strong>3–3.2% per year</strong>, below the long-term average,
      with inflation gradually returning towards central-bank targets.
      The IMF’s World Economic Outlook (Oct 2025) projects global
      GDP growth of about 3.3% in 2024, 3.2% in 2025 and 3.1% in 2026,
      with advanced economies growing near 1.5%.
      The OECD’s Economic Outlook paints a very similar picture:
      steady but modest growth and a slow disinflation process.
    </p>
    <p>
      On top of this macro backdrop, investment banks build their
      equity scenarios. <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> and others
      stress that with such growth and inflation, risk assets
      can still have tailwinds, but the distribution of outcomes is
      wider than a few years ago (geopolitics, fiscal policy,
      elections, trade tensions).
      <strong>Evercore ISI</strong> openly uses a
      “big beautiful bubble” narrative for US equities, with a base
      case for the S&amp;P 500 near <strong>7750</strong> by end-2026
      and a non-zero probability path towards <strong>9000</strong> if
      AI-driven earnings growth and risk appetite persist.
    </p>
    <p>
      All levels and ranges in this text are
      <strong>illustrative and hypothetical</strong>.
      This is an educational overview — <strong>not</strong> investment
      advice and not a recommendation to buy or sell any instrument.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- 1M -->
  <section id="scenario-1m" class="card">
    <h2>1. 1M horizon — tactical scenario and liquidity</h2>

    <h3>Momentum, CTAs and short-term volatility</h3>
    <p>
      In the very short run, markets are dominated by:
      <strong>labour-market data</strong>,
      short-term rates (SOFR),
      systematic/CTA positioning,
      and flows into trend-following strategies.
      When a long streak of trading above the 50-day moving average
      finally breaks, many CTA models mechanically reduce long
      exposure, which can amplify short but sharp pullbacks
      in the order of several percent.
    </p>

    <h3>SOFR, the TGA and the plumbing of the system</h3>
    <p>
      Since the pandemic, investors have learned to watch not only
      the level of policy rates, but the
      <strong>liquidity plumbing</strong>:
      the short-term funding rate (SOFR) and the
      <strong>Treasury General Account (TGA)</strong> balance at the Fed
      influence the amount of bank reserves and financial conditions.
      A rapid rebuild of the TGA after debt-ceiling episodes typically
      means a temporary liquidity drain, which can produce an
      “air pocket” in risk assets — sudden drops even if the
      macro data have not changed dramatically.
    </p>

    <h3>Base case (1M)</h3>
    <p>
      Taking into account:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>still relatively low near-term recession risk in the US
          in IMF/OECD assessments,</li>
      <li>expectations that the Fed’s first meaningful rate cuts
          arrive more in 2026 than immediately,</li>
      <li>CTA positioning after an extended up-trend,</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      the <strong>base-case 1M scenario</strong> is:
      a correction and elevated volatility
      <strong>within an ongoing bull market</strong>.
      We can expect back-and-forth moves triggered by macro releases
      and Fed communication, but no clear signal yet that the cycle
      is over.
    </p>
    <p>
      In practice, this means that in such a short horizon
      risk management (position sizing, leverage, stop-loss levels)
      matters more than trying to catch every small swing.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- 6M -->
  <section id="scenario-6m" class="card">
    <h2>2. 6M horizon — to mid-2026 (macro, AI and end of tightening)</h2>

    <h3>Macro: moderate but positive growth</h3>
    <p>
      On a six-month horizon, the macro environment dominates.
      The IMF’s WEO 2025 and the OECD’s Outlook both suggest a world
      that is <strong>not in recession, but not booming either</strong>:
      steady growth, slightly below pre-pandemic averages, and
      inflation slowly moving towards target ranges.
    </p>
    <p>
      For equities, the key ingredients are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>inflation drifting closer to central-bank targets,</li>
      <li>no sudden spike in unemployment,</li>
      <li>a gradual move of policy rates from “restrictive” towards
          “neutral” territory as the Fed and ECB finish their
          hiking cycles and start cautious cuts.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      With that backdrop, <strong>most large-bank 6–12M outlooks
      remain constructive</strong> for risk assets, but with a strong
      caveat: valuations are elevated, and the market has become
      more discriminating across sectors and single names.
    </p>

    <h3>AI, capex and corporate earnings</h3>
    <p>
      Many houses (Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, UBS, JPMorgan and
      others) expect investment in AI, automation and energy
      infrastructure to be a key driver of S&amp;P 500 earnings in
      the coming years. In their base cases, index-level earnings
      grow at a mid-single- to low-double-digit pace, which,
      assuming stable margins and no recession, can support
      indices near or above previous highs.
    </p>

    <h3>QT, the TGA and bank reserves</h3>
    <p>
      From a liquidity perspective, a move from aggressive
      <strong>quantitative tightening (QT)</strong> towards a more neutral
      Fed balance sheet, together with a stabilised TGA balance,
      usually supports easier financial conditions: 
      credit spreads are less volatile and the market absorbs
      Treasury issuance more smoothly.
    </p>

    <h3>Base case (6M)</h3>
    <p>
      The <strong>6M base case</strong> can be summarised as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>one or more 8–12% corrections along the way,</li>
      <li>no hard landing in the US economy,</li>
      <li>the “soft-landing / no-landing” narrative remaining
          the dominant one,</li>
      <li>the S&amp;P 500 revisiting or slightly exceeding prior highs
          if earnings deliver against expectations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This is still an environment where “buying the dip” can work,
      but no longer “buy anything at any price”.
      Sector and quality selection (balance sheet strength,
      cash-flow generation, real AI projects instead of pure stories)
      becomes critical.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- 12M -->
  <section id="scenario-12m" class="card">
    <h2>3. 12M horizon — to end-2026 (late bull and bubble tail risk)</h2>

    <h3>Global picture: the “tepid twenties”</h3>
    <p>
      IMF and OECD economists increasingly talk about
      “tepid twenties” — a decade of <strong>cool-ish growth</strong> with
      recurring shocks (wars, trade frictions, energy transition),
      rather than a return to the pre-2008 boom.
      IMF projections point to global growth around 3.3% in 2024,
      3.2% in 2025 and 3.1% in 2026; the OECD’s Interim Outlook
      suggests similar numbers, even dipping towards ~2.9% in
      some scenarios.
    </p>
    <p>
      For equities, this implies that the long-term “growth from the
      real economy” is modest. For the S&amp;P 500 to grow faster,
      we need a combination of:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>earnings growth,</li>
      <li>multiple expansion (higher P/E),</li>
      <li>and, in the more extreme path, outright over-paying for
          AI-related stories.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Valuations, AI and the “big beautiful bubble”</h3>
    <p>
      Analysts at Evercore ISI, Morgan Stanley, Schroders and others
      highlight several facts:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>on most metrics (P/E, CAPE, yield gap vs Treasuries),
          S&amp;P 500 valuations are above long-term averages,</li>
      <li>market cap is extremely concentrated in a dozen or so
          mega-cap tech/AI names,</li>
      <li>retail and passive flows increasingly buy the index
          regardless of valuation levels.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Evercore ISI’s base case sees the S&amp;P 500 near
      <strong>7750</strong> by end-2026, but their “bubble scenario”
      stretches towards <strong>9000</strong> if AI-related earnings,
      lower rates and risk appetite all line up favourably.
      The probability of that path is limited but not zero.
    </p>

    <h3>Base case (12M)</h3>
    <p>
      Given today’s macro data and analyst consensus, the
      <strong>12M base case</strong> looks roughly like this:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>the S&amp;P 500 has a non-zero chance of ending 2026
          higher than today (positive nominal returns),</li>
      <li>real returns will be lower because inflation eats part
          of those nominal gains,</li>
      <li>at least one 15–25% drawdown along the way is very
          plausible, driven by macro or geopolitical surprise
          (trade wars, elections, conflict in Asia, etc.),</li>
      <li>the further the index moves above base-case targets
          (say, well beyond 7400–7600), the more it makes sense
          to <em>reduce</em> risk at the margin rather than increase it.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This is not a classic “crash call”, but rather an emphasis
      on <strong>asymmetry</strong>: there is upside left, but
      each extra +10% in price is bought with a worse
      reward-to-risk profile.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- BUY / SELL ZONES -->
  <section id="levels" class="card">
    <h2>Buy &amp; sell zones — 1M / 6M / 12M</h2>
    <p>
      The following buy and sell zones are <strong>indicative only</strong>
      and aligned with the base scenarios above. They are not
      “hard signals”, but ranges where the
      <em>reward-to-risk trade-off</em> typically looks better (buy zones)
      or worse (sell / de-risk zones) in a late-cycle bull market.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a reference point we use the S&amp;P 500 level around
      <strong>6617 (19 Nov 2025)</strong> and historically typical
      late-cycle pullbacks: a few percent in the very short term,
      around 8–12% over a half-year window and up to 15–25% in a
      12-month window without a full-blown recession.
    </p>

    <h3>1M — tactical levels</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Potential buy zone (1M):</strong>
        <span class="text-success">6350–6450</span>  
        (roughly 3–4% below the reference level).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Potential sell / take-profit zone (1M):</strong>
        <span class="text-danger">6850–6950</span>  
        (roughly 3–5% above the reference level).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Rationale:</strong> in the very short term, price action
      is driven mainly by technicals (30–60 day moving averages),
      CTA/trend-follower flows and liquidity shifts (SOFR, TGA).
      A 3–4% pullback often brings the index back towards shorter
      moving averages where, in the absence of bad macro news,
      institutional demand tends to re-appear.
      Conversely, a quick 3–5% breakout above recent highs without
      a fundamental catalyst frequently triggers short-term
      profit-taking.
    </p>

    <h3>6M — half-year cycle</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Potential buy zone (6M):</strong>
        <span class="text-success">5900–6100</span>  
        (about 8–12% below the reference level).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Potential sell / de-risk zone (6M):</strong>
        <span class="text-danger">7100–7300</span>  
        (around 7–10% above the reference level).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Rationale:</strong> on a six-month horizon,
      late-cycle bull markets often see 10% pullbacks that drive
      the index below longer moving averages (MA60–100) but do
      not break the uptrend — provided that:
      growth and labour data remain reasonable and central banks
      are moving from tightening towards neutral or modest easing.
      From a valuation standpoint, the 7100–7300 area implies
      clearly higher multiples relative to bond yields; the
      reward-to-risk for adding new long exposure becomes less
      attractive there.
    </p>

    <h3>12M — strategic levels towards end-2026</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Long-term buy zone (12M):</strong>
        <span class="text-success">5500–5700</span>  
        (about 13–17% below the reference level).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Very high valuation / structural de-risk zone (12M):</strong>
        <span class="text-danger">7400–7600</span>  
        (around 12–15% above the reference level).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Rationale:</strong> over a full year, the probability
      of a deeper “flush-out” rises — 15–25% drawdowns have occurred
      many times in history without a Great-Recession-type event
      (examples: 2011, 2015–2016, 2018).
      The 5500–5700 zone corresponds to such a cyclical correction
      but not yet to a deep secular bear market.
      On the other side, the 7400–7600 zone is broadly in line
      with major banks’ base-case targets for end-2026; beyond
      that area, the market would be trading in an
      “extremely rich valuation” regime where any negative macro,
      policy or regulatory surprise could trigger sharp
      profit-taking.
    </p>

    <p class="tagline">
      <strong>Important:</strong> these ranges should not be treated
      as automatic trade signals. They are an <em>orientation map</em>
      to help think about the scale of corrections and upside
      potential in the context of a late-cycle bull market,
      liquidity (SOFR, TGA), valuations and consensus research.
