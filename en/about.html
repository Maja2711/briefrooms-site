    <h1>About BriefRooms</h1>
    <p class="sub">
      A short explanation of how BriefRooms works,
      which sources we rely on, and what you can use it for.

      <p>
        BriefRooms was created for people who want to stay informed
        but do not have time to read dozens of long articles every day.
        Instead of flooding you with information, we pick the most relevant
        topics and turn them into short, practical summaries.
      </p>

      <p>
        The platform is organised into four rooms:
        <strong>News, Geopolitics, Health and Science</strong>.
        In each room you will find selected materials from reliable sources,
        written in clear language and focused on what really matters:
        key claims, main takeaways and potential consequences.
      </p>

      <h2>Sources, research and the search for truth</h2>

      <p>
        Our goal is to rely only on
        <strong>trusted sources and research</strong>,
        so that we can move step by step towards the truth,
        <strong>regardless of what that truth turns out to be</strong>.
        Whenever robust data contradict popular narratives,
        we prioritise evidence and methodology over convenient stories.
      </p>

      <p>In practice this means that we try to:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          base our main claims on solid studies, reports
          or sources with a known level of reliability,
        </li>
        <li>
          clearly separate what follows directly from the data
          from commentary, interpretation and hypotheses,
        </li>
        <li>
          highlight areas where scientific knowledge is limited
          or where studies give conflicting results.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>AI in the background, humans in control</h2>

      <p>
        In the background we use <strong>AI (artificial intelligence)</strong>
        to search sources and generate first drafts of briefs.
        Every summary is then reviewed and edited by a human
        to keep it concise, understandable and as unbiased as possible.
      </p>

      <h2>How should you use BriefRooms?</h2>

      <p>
        We are not a traditional news portal,
        nor do we provide financial or medical advice.
        Think of BriefRooms as a <strong>starting point</strong>:
        a quick overview of the key information that helps you decide
        what is worth exploring further in the original,
        specialist sources.
