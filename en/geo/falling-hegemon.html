  <!-- EXECUTIVE SUMMARY -->
  <section id="exec" class="card exec-summary">
    <h2>Executive summary</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>The US-led liberal order is in sustained erosion, not sudden collapse.</strong> Institutions, rules and alliance networks built after 1945 still function, but they increasingly operate in a world where Western dominance is no longer absolute.</li>
      <li><strong>Four clusters of stressors drive this erosion:</strong> China’s spectacular rise and global ambitions, the activism of revisionist powers (Russia, Iran, North Korea), internal crises within the West (polarisation, populism, isolationism) and the accumulation of global challenges (climate, tech, de-globalisation) that the old order struggles to manage.</li>
      <li><strong>Talking about an inevitable “fall of the hegemon” oversimplifies reality.</strong> The US is losing some relative economic and normative primacy, but retains unique systemic advantages: alliance networks, the dollar’s role, tech leadership, universities and innovation ecosystems, plus favourable geography.</li>
      <li><strong>The most plausible outcome is a hybrid order – a “multiplex” world.</strong> No single hegemon, several power centres (US, China, EU, India and others), partial de-globalisation and regionalisation, hard rivalry in technology and security, but selective multilateral cooperation where no actor can go it alone.</li>
      <li><strong>The Global South and middle powers become pivotal swing players.</strong> For countries like Poland, this means reinforcing core alliances (US, NATO, EU), building domestic resilience and managing risk carefully during an “interregnum” when the old order is cracking and the new one is not yet settled.</li>

  <!-- 1. INTRO -->
  <section id="intro" class="card">
    <h2>1) Introduction</h2>
    <p><strong>“Shifting world order – decline of the Hegemon?”</strong> captures a growing sense that the political and economic architecture of the international system is undergoing a structural transformation. From the end of World War II through the early 21st century, the core of global order was a US-led liberal system built on multilateral institutions, shared rules and American security guarantees.</p>

    <p>Today, multiple trends point to stress and fragmentation: the rise of China, assertive revisionist powers, internal crises within Western democracies, and global challenges that existing institutions struggle to handle. Commentators talk about the “end of the West”, the “twilight of Pax Americana” or “breakdown of the liberal international order”. At the same time, think tanks and scholars point to the resilience and adaptability of the system, and to the absence of a fully credible alternative.</p>

    <p>This brief confronts popular narratives about the “fall” of US hegemony with assessments from leading analytical centres (RAND, CSIS, Brookings, Carnegie, Chatham House, RUSI, Atlantic Council, CFR and others). It asks whether we are facing an irreversible decline of American primacy, a transition towards a more complex multi-centre order, or a messy mix of both.</p>

    <p>The goal is to sketch <strong>what kind of international architecture is likely to emerge in the coming decades</strong> and what practical implications this has for states caught between large power centres.</p>

  <!-- 2. LIBERAL ORDER -->
  <section id="liberal-order" class="card">
    <h2>2) The post-war liberal order and US hegemony</h2>

    <h3>2.1. Building the post-1945 international architecture</h3>
    <p>After two devastating world wars, key powers – led by the United States – constructed a new architecture for international cooperation. The United Nations, the Bretton Woods system (IMF and World Bank), GATT/WTO and, in Europe, integration that later became the European Union, formed the basic skeleton of this order.</p>

    <p>The aim was to avoid a return to the chaos of the interwar period: <strong>replace competitive blocs and economic autarky with rule-based cooperation and open trade</strong>. Despite many proxy wars and regional conflicts, the system helped to prevent another global total war and underpinned decades of unprecedented economic growth and globalisation.</p>

    <h3>2.2. The United States as architect and guarantor</h3>
    <p>The US was not only the main victor of World War II but also the central architect and guarantor of the new system. Economic, technological and military dominance allowed Washington to build alliances and institutions that stabilised the international environment. As John Ikenberry put it, America became a “liberal Leviathan” – a hegemon that exercised leadership by embedding its power in shared rules and institutions rather than ruling by diktat alone.</p>

    <p>Even though the US share of global GDP fell from roughly half of the world economy just after 1945 to about one quarter today, the system endured because <strong>its rules and institutions delivered benefits to many actors, not only to Washington</strong>. US leadership was based on a combination of hard power (military, economic) and soft power (cultural attractiveness, political model, values).</p>

    <p>The US secured sea lanes, issued the main reserve currency (the dollar), stabilised financial markets and often acted as “lender of last resort” in crises. Its alliance system – NATO in Europe and a hub-and-spokes network in Asia – allowed allies to grow without engaging in massive arms races of their own.</p>

    <h3>2.3. A “rules-based order”: benefits and limits</h3>
    <p>This model is often described as a <em>rules-based international order</em>. Its three pillars were: multilateral institutions (UN, Bretton Woods, WTO), a shared normative package (international law, human rights, open trade) and US leadership as an enforcer of basic rules. The result was rising trade volumes, dramatic poverty reduction in many regions, expansion of democratic governance and relative stability among great powers.</p>

    <p>However, the liberal order had built-in limits and contradictions. <strong>First, it was never truly universal</strong> – parts of the world remained outside or perceived it as a vehicle for Western dominance. <strong>Second, the hegemon did not always follow its own rules consistently</strong>, for example in interventions without UN mandates or selective approaches to human rights, fuelling accusations of hypocrisy. <strong>Third, globalisation produced winners and losers inside Western societies</strong>, contributing to populist backlash.</p>

    <p>In short, the post-war liberal order delivered a historically unique period of stability and prosperity, with the US at its core. As Stewart Patrick notes, for eight decades the world had a hegemon willing to lead, pay and fight for an open international system. The key question now is whether that era is ending.</p>

  <!-- 3. EROSION -->
  <section id="erosion" class="card">
    <h2>3) Erosion of the order and stress on US leadership</h2>

    <h3>3.1. China’s rise and Beijing’s global ambitions</h3>
    <p>The most serious challenge to US leadership is the rise of the People’s Republic of China. Since Deng Xiaoping’s reforms, China has moved from a poor developing country to the world’s second-largest economy (and, by some measures, the largest in PPP terms). Economic success has funded military modernisation, technology development and global diplomatic and financial outreach.</p>

    <p>Initiatives such as the <strong>Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)</strong>, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), large-scale investments across Africa, Asia and Latin America, and the strengthening of formats like the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) or BRICS+ demonstrate Beijing’s ambition to co-shape – and in some domains redefine – the international order on more “China-friendly” terms.</p>

    <p>From Beijing’s vantage point, the last 15 years – from the 2008 financial crisis through the West’s chaotic response to COVID-19 and internal political crises in the US – reinforced the belief that “time and momentum are on China’s side”. Official narratives speak of a “historic window of opportunity” for China to move from regional to global centrality.</p>

    <p>China has also articulated its own vision of order – from the “Community with a Shared Future for Mankind” to calls for “true multilateralism” in contrast with what it labels Western dominance. Beijing increasingly presents itself as a voice for the Global South, offering infrastructure, loans and vaccines while promising “win-win” cooperation.</p>

    <p>Alongside this, Beijing has drawn <strong>clear red lines</strong> on issues such as Taiwan, regime security and human rights, and portrays efforts to constrain its rise as illegitimate “containment”. A competitor has emerged that is able, in economic, military and institutional terms, to contest key elements of US primacy.</p>

    <h3>3.2. Revisionist powers and open contestation of the order</h3>
    <p>Beyond China, elements of the order are challenged by <strong>revisionist powers</strong> – above all Russia, but also Iran and North Korea. Moscow has sought to overturn parts of the post-Cold War settlement and restore great-power status through military aggression (Georgia 2008, Crimea 2014, the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022), energy leverage, cyber operations and disinformation campaigns.</p>

    <p>In various ways, Russia, China, Iran and North Korea form what some analysts call an “ecosystem of revisionists” testing the West’s red lines and the effectiveness of international institutions. Joint military exercises, diplomatic coordination and the Sino-Russian “no limits” partnership create the perception that the US-led order is openly contested.</p>

    <h3>3.3. Internal crises in the West: populism, isolationism, division</h3>
    <p>Erosion of US leadership is also driven by <strong>domestic fractures within Western democracies</strong>. In the US, deep polarisation, declining trust in institutions and recurrent isolationist impulses (“America First”) challenge the political foundations of global leadership. In Europe, crises of the eurozone, migration, Brexit and rising support for anti-system parties have undermined cohesion.</p>

    <p>For allies and partners, this raises doubts about the reliability of Western commitments. If US policies swing sharply from administration to administration on climate, trade or alliances, long-term strategic planning becomes difficult. Tensions within the transatlantic relationship, disputes over industrial policy and the costs of the green transition add further stress.</p>

    <h3>3.4. Global challenges and weak international governance</h3>
    <p>Global challenges – climate change, pandemics, inequality, disruptive technologies – expose the limits of institutions designed in the mid-20th century. Health and climate crises show that without effective multilateralism no actor can manage systemic risks alone. Yet precisely in these domains we see <strong>paralysis of core bodies</strong> like the UN Security Council or the WTO, blocked by great-power rivalry.</p>

    <p>Partial de-globalisation is already underway: shorter and more regional supply chains (re-shoring, friend-shoring), trade wars (US–China), subsidy races for green industries, and growing restrictions on technology flows (chips, AI, 5G). Technology has become a key arena of hard competition, while the lack of global rules in cyberspace encourages hacking, influence operations and electoral interference.</p>

    <p>As Terrence Mullan notes, world orders rarely disappear overnight. They <strong>decay gradually, often undermined by their own architects</strong>. This slow-motion decay is what we are witnessing with the liberal order created under US leadership.</p>

  <!-- 4. FALL OF THE HEGEMON? -->
  <section id="hegemon-fall" class="card">
    <h2>4) Fall of the Hegemon? Arguments for and against</h2>

    <h3>4.1. The “end of hegemony” thesis</h3>
    <p>One camp – including authors such as Alexander Cooley and Daniel Nexon and many essays in <em>Foreign Affairs</em> and <em>The Economist</em> – argues that the <strong>unipolar moment was a historical anomaly</strong>. In this view, a return to a more “normal” multipolar landscape is inevitable as US relative power declines and other centres rise.</p>

    <p>Key arguments include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Unravelling US leadership</strong> through unilateral wars, periods of retrenchment and scepticism towards multilateralism, which erode the legitimacy of the order;</li>
      <li><strong>Rising rivals</strong> – China and other powers demanding a greater say and refusing to accept a US monopoly on setting the rules;</li>
      <li><strong>Internal crisis of liberal democracy</strong> – polarisation, populism and declining trust in elites and institutions.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Pessimists often draw analogies to the British Empire’s decline: once fiscal and political constraints accumulated, London could no longer underwrite global order, and the vacuum contributed to instability and war. Niall Ferguson and others warn that withdrawal of a hegemon can lead not to smooth power transfer but to <strong>hegemonic wars</strong> if rising powers seek to revise the status quo by force.</p>

    <h3>4.2. Systemic advantages and resilience of the United States</h3>
    <p>Other analysts – at RAND, CSIS, the Atlantic Council and elsewhere – caution that talk of the “end of America” is premature. They highlight enduring <strong>systemic advantages</strong>: the world’s most extensive alliance and basing network, the dollar’s central role, leading positions in many high-tech sectors, globally attractive universities and innovation hubs, and highly favourable geography (no hostile neighbours, two oceans as buffers).</p>

    <p>The “cautious optimists” argue that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>while the <strong>unipolar moment is over</strong>, the US is likely to remain the single most powerful actor, able to assemble coalitions and shape agendas;</li>
      <li>China’s rise does not automatically translate into dominance – Beijing faces major internal headwinds (demography, debt, governance constraints);</li>
      <li>many Global South states are wary of over-dependence on any single patron and seek to hedge, rather than join a clear-cut anti-Western bloc.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Recent events have also highlighted <strong>Western resilience</strong>. Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine strengthened NATO (accession of Finland and Sweden, higher defence spending) and confirmed that the US is still indispensable for European security. The EU, despite previous crises, showed unity on sanctions and managed the energy shock. In Asia, US allies (Japan, South Korea, Australia) deepened cooperation in response to China’s assertiveness.</p>

    <p>In sum, the debate is not between “hegemony intact” and “hegemony gone”, but about the <strong>pace and shape of relative decline</strong>. The most likely outcome is an America still central to world politics, but forced to share power and adjust rules to a more contested environment.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- 5. NEW ORDER -->
  <section id="new-order" class="card">
    <h2>5) New world order – scenarios and perspectives</h2>

    <h3>5.1. Multipolar world: rival blocs or managed coexistence?</h3>
    <p>If the old order is weakening, the natural question is: <strong>what comes next?</strong> Most scenario exercises by major think tanks envisage some form of multipolarity – several significant power centres rather than one dominant hegemon. But multipolarity can take very different forms.</p>

    <p><strong>Conflictual multipolarity (“world of blocs”)</strong> would mean that major powers consolidate around rival geopolitical and geo-economic camps. In an extreme version, this would resemble a new bipolarity in multipolar clothing: on one side a China-centric camp with Russia and other authoritarian partners; on the other, a US-led coalition of democracies. The likely outcomes: fragmented globalisation, decoupled technology systems, financial bifurcation and elevated risk of great-power war.</p>

    <p><strong>Cooperative multipolarity (“concert of powers”)</strong> would instead resemble a modernised Concert of Europe: great powers accept each other’s core interests, seek to avoid direct confrontation and renegotiate rules of the game. Institutions like the UN, G20 or regional organisations would be re-tooled to reflect a broader distribution of power.</p>

    <p>In practice, we already see <strong>a messy mix</strong>: bloc-like tensions in security and technology, but also ongoing cooperation in areas like climate, health or financial stability, where no actor can succeed alone.</p>

    <h3>5.2. China’s role and the “multiplex” order</h3>
    <p>China’s role in any future order deserves separate attention. Some argue Beijing aspires to become a new global hegemon replacing the US. Others suggest China seeks <strong>co-hegemony and recognition of its sphere of influence</strong> rather than a full takeover of US responsibilities.</p>

    <p>Amitav Acharya’s concept of a <em>“multiplex world order”</em> is useful here. A multiplex order is like a multi-screen cinema: different “shows” (orders) run in parallel across regions and issue-areas, and states participate in several at once. China would be one of the main producers of global “content”, but not the sole scriptwriter.</p>

    <p>In a multiplex world, re-globalisation would be increasingly driven by Asia and the Global South. Chinese-backed institutions (BRI, AIIB, BRICS+) would coexist with Western-centred frameworks, creating a layered and fragmented architecture rather than a single hierarchy.</p>

    <h3>5.3. Global South and “non-alignment 2.0”</h3>
    <p>The <strong>Global South</strong> is another critical piece of the puzzle. Many states in Asia, Africa and Latin America do not want to be simple peripheries of the West or China. Instead, they practise “non-alignment 2.0”: taking investment and security cooperation from multiple partners, hedging their bets and maximising autonomy.</p>

    <p>Atlantic Council assessments suggest that China’s dominance over the Global South is far from inevitable. Governments often welcome Chinese finance and infrastructure, but are simultaneously wary of debt dependence and seek alternatives (for example, the G7’s Global Gateway and similar initiatives). In this sense, the Global South is becoming a <strong>swing constituency</strong> in great-power competition.</p>

    <h3>5.4. Future of institutions and multilateralism</h3>
    <p>What will happen to institutions created after 1945? One scenario is slow hollowing-out: formal existence with declining effectiveness. Another is reform – for example expanding the UN Security Council to include India or Brazil, or strengthening G20 as the main forum for global governance.</p>

    <p>Stewart Patrick warns of a “League of Nations 2.0”: structures still on paper but lacking political will. An alternative is <strong>more inclusive multilateralism</strong> that gives greater voice to rising powers while preserving basic cooperative rules. For Western states this implies sharing influence and updating institutions rather than defending the exact status quo.</p>

    <p>Michael Mazarr and colleagues at RAND argue that without intellectual and political renewal, attempts to build a new order will fail – and humanity will be ill-equipped to handle existential challenges such as climate, proliferation and disruptive technologies. At the same time, many elements of the old order (open trade in more regional form, selected UN-based formats) are likely to survive in reduced but still meaningful roles.</p>

    <h2>6) Takeaways</h2>
    <p>The analysis suggests that the architecture of the international system is being re-shaped by <strong>relative US decline, China’s rise and the assertiveness of other actors</strong>. Yet the “fall of the hegemon” is not a single moment, nor a binary switch from order to chaos. It is a drawn-out process with overlapping phases.</p>

    <p>The old liberal order is fracturing, but many of its components are likely to persist and bleed into whatever comes next. Arguments for a permanent end of US primacy are supported by clear trends in power distribution and domestic constraints. At the same time, there is <strong>no fully formed alternative system</strong> ready to replace the US-anchored one wholesale.</p>

    <p>The most realistic outcome is some variant of <strong>multi-centre or polycentric order</strong>: several major powers and blocs coexisting in a partially shared, partially contested set of arrangements. Acharya calls this a multiplex world; others speak of “disorderly order”. This implies higher risk and volatility, but also space for agency by middle powers and regional actors.</p>

    <p>For middle-sized states such as Poland, this environment demands an <strong>agile strategy</strong>: reinforcing core alliances where they are indispensable (e.g., with the US in NATO), while diversifying economic and technological partnerships, investing in resilience and monitoring global trends carefully. The transition between old and new orders is historically the most dangerous phase.</p>

    <p>The new world order is already being negotiated in practice. <strong>Whether it becomes more peaceful or conflict-prone, more inclusive or exclusionary</strong>, will depend on decisions taken now by leaders, societies and institutions. Understanding the drivers and fault lines of the changing order is a prerequisite for steering it – rather than simply enduring it.</p>
